            <u>Thor</u> is the Asgardian god of thunder and a member of the Avengers. He wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, which grants him the ability to fly and manipulate weather, particularly thunder and lightning. Thor is known for his immense strength, durability, and longevity, making him one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel Universe.

            Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father of Asgard, and the elder goddess Gaea. He is sent to Earth by Odin to learn humility, where he adopts the human identity of Dr. Donald Blake. Over time, Thor becomes a defender of both Asgard and Earth, often finding himself torn between his responsibilities to his homeland and his love for humanity.
